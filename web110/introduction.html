        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I grew up in Charlotte, NC, 
                and New Orleans, LA. I have also lived in New York, Los Angeles, 
                &amp; Hastings (UK).</li>
            <li><strong>Professional/Academic background:</strong> I have been in Legal Records 
                Management for 15 years and Deskside Support for 7 years. I currently 
                work for one of the largest law firms in the world. Although I am 
                already in the field I want to be in, it has been a challenge advancing 
                and I decided to go back to school to get my degree and some certifications 
                along the way. After this summer, I will only have 2 courses remaining on 
                my IT Business Analyst degree. After completion, I am transferring to ECU 
                to complete a B.S. in Industrial Technology. I will primarily focus on 
                Networking, Virtualization/Cloud, & Database.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> I 
                have been building and repairing computers and electronics since I was 
                10 years old. I have been using Mac, Windows, &amp; Linux for as long as I 
                can remember. I have always had a passion for technology and everything 
                related to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> I don&#39;t really have a primary 
                platform as I use several different ones every day. At work, I am using 
                Windows 7 and at home, I am using Windows 10 (mainly for gaming). I also 
                have a MacBook and iPad that go with me everywhere. Additionally, I use 
                virtualization software for Linux. For most light work, I will start on 
                my iPad and if it will take some serious typing, I will use my MacBook. 
                Working in deskside support has taught me that you need to know enough 
                to assist with multiple platforms and OS'.</li>
            <li><strong>Reason for taking each course:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>WEB 110-85:</em> Fundamentals of Internet/Web Technologies - 
                Originally I was not supposed to take this course as my catalog year 
                required a different course that is no longer available. When my catalog 
                year was updated, this was the replacement course.</li>
                    <li><em>BIO 110-02:</em> Principles of Biology - I am taking this course 
                as it is needed as a prerequisite for ECU.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            <li><strong>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember 
                you by:</strong> I was in the music industry as an artist/producer/DJ for 
                over 20 years. I started at the age of 13 and it was kind of the reason I 
                got into the IT industry. Working in studios and being on the road, you 
                had to learn how to be self-sufficient with your equipment and brand. I 
                learned a little bit about graphic design, coding, software/hardware 
                support, just due to being a struggling artist and not being able to pay 
                people for it.</li>
            <li><strong>I&#39;d also like to share:</strong> As if being into computers 
                wasn&#39;t nerdy enough, I&#39;m also a huge comic book collector and gamer. 
                I go to comic book, anime, and gaming conventions every year.</li>
        </ul>
